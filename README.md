# NIRMITI

The Mess Management System is a software application made by me for my hostel mess Nirmiti. designed to efficiently manage and streamline the operations of the hostel mess(Nirmiti) . The primary aim of this project is to enhance the overall mess experience for the students by automating various tasks related **Attendance**, **Subscription Management** and billing. The system ensures smooth and hassle-free functioning, allowing students and mess staff to focus on other essential aspects of hostel life.
